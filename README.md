# Hall of Us

Welcome to **Hall of Us**, a museum-inspired social memories app developed during **HackGT**. This project combines cutting-edge technology with a creative theme to bring memories to life in a collaborative and interactive way.

## Project Highlights

- **Hackathon Theme**: Designed for HackGT, this project revolves around the concept of a digital museum where users can create, share, and explore social memories.
- **Cedar OS Integration**: Leveraged Cedar OS to seamlessly integrate AI agents into our React context, enabling dynamic and intelligent interactions.
- **Custom Backend Debugging**: Built and debugged custom backends to support the app's unique features and ensure smooth data flow.
- **Touch Wrapper for Cedar Spells**: Developed a new touch wrapper compatible with Cedar spells, enhancing the app's interactivity and user experience.
- **Next.js Framework**: Utilized Next.js for its powerful server-side rendering and API capabilities.
